## Question Text

You are writing a program that keeps track of where your money goes. Make a program called <tt>BankAccount</tt> that has attributes named <tt>accountNumber</tt> and <tt>currentBalance</tt> which are initialized by a constructor. The class has methods to deposit money into the account, withdraw money from the account, display information about the account, and additional methods that are necessary to complete those. The program also has a basic test class which creates an account with $100 and another with $0, deposits $400 dollars into the second account, and displays information from both accounts at the end.
