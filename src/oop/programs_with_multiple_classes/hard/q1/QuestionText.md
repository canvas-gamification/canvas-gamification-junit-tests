# oop-programs_with_multiple_classes-hard-q1

You want to write a program that models a group of people in a circus. To do this, create a Java program with two
classes: `Circus` and `Member`. See the requirements below for each class.

## Circus Class

Your `Circus` class should have the following items:

- Attributes:
    - An `int` called **numMembers**
- Constructors:
    - A `public Circus(int)` constructor which initializes the **numMembers** field with the passed integer

## Member Class

Your `Member` class should have the following items:

- Attributes:
    - A `String` called **title**
- Constructors:
    - A `public Member(String)` constructor which initializes the *title* field with the passed String

  ```
