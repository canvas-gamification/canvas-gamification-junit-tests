# oop-programs_with_multiple_classes-hard-q2

You want to write a program that models a group of people and their blanket fort. To do this, create a Java program with
two classes: `Person` and `Blanket`. See the requirements below for each class.

## Person Class

Your `Person` class should have the following items:

- Attributes:
    - A `double` called **height**
- Constructors:
    - A constructor which accepts a double to initialize the **height** field and is accessible from other classes

## Blanket Class

Your `Blanket` class should have the following items:

- Attributes:
    - A `String` called **size**
    - An `int` called **threadCount**
- Constructors:
    - A constructor which accepts a String to initialize the **size** field and an int to initialize the **threadCount**
    - This constructor should be accessible from other classes
