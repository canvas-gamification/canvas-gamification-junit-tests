# oop-programs_with_multiple_classes-hard-q3

You want to write a program that models books in a bookcase. To do this, create a Java program with two
classes: `Book` and `Bookcase`. See the requirements below for each class.

## Book Class

Your `Book` class should have the following items:

- Attributes:
    - An `int` called **count**
    - A `String` called **type**
- Constructors:
    - A constructor which accepts a String to initialize the **count** field and an int to initialize the
      **type** field and is accessible from other classes

## Bookcase Class

Your `Bookcase` class should have the following items:

- Attributes:
    - A `int` called **sizeCapacity**
- Constructors:
    - A constructor which accepts an int to initialize the **sizeCapacity** field and is accessible from other classes
