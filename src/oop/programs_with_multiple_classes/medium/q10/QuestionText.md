## Java

You want to write a program that models objects within a house and different rooms. Make a Java program
consisting of a `Vegetable` and a `Cupboard`. See the requirements below for each class. Note that parts of each class are
already provided, you only need to implement the other portions.

## Vegetable

our `Vegetable` class currently has the attributes `boolean isSpoiled`, `double weight`,
and `String countryOfOrigin`. Create a constructor which is accessible from another class
and initializes these fields in that order. Also, write a method called **eating** that
decreases the value of **weight** by 0.5, and is accessible from other classes

## Cupboard

Your `Cupboard` class currently has a constructor, but is missing the fields the constructor sets. Based on the
constructor, add the **size** and **colour** fields of the appropriate type to the table class.
