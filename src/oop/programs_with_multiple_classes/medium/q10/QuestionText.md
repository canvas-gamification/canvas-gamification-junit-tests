**Parsons with Distractors**

You want to write a program that models food and different storage containers. Make a Java program with the following requirements:


## Vegetable

Your `Vegetable` class should have the following items:

- Attributes:
    - A `boolean` called **isSpoiled**
    - A `double` called **weight**
    - A `String` called **countryOfOrigin**

- Constructors:
    - A `public Vegetable(boolean, double, String)` constructor to set  values
      of **isSpoiled**, **weight**, **countryOfOrigin** and to trues
- Methods:
    - A `public eating()` method that decrements the **weight** variable by 0.5

  

## Cupboard

Your ``Cupboard`` class should have the following items:

- Attributes:
    - An `int` called **size**
    - A `String` called **colour**

- Constructors:
    - A `public Cupboard(int, String)` constructor to set the
      **size** and **colour** fields
  

**Distractors**
- public boolean isSpoiled;
- public double weight;
- public String countryOfOrigin;
- public int size;
- public String colour;
- size = s;
- colour = m;
- weight --;
- isSpoiled = s;
- weight = b;
- countryOfOrigin = d;
