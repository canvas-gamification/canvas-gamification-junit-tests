## Java

You want to write a program that models kitchen utensils and kitchen tools. Make a Java program 
consisting of a `Knife` and a `Cupboard`. See the requirements below for each class. Note that parts of each class are
already provided, you only need to implement the other portions.


## Knife

Your `Knife` class currently has the attributes `int size` and `String materialType`. Create a
constructor which is accessible from another class and initializes these fields in that order.

## Cupboard

Your `Cupboard` class currently has a constructor, but is missing the fields the constructor sets. Based on the
constructor, add the **capacity** and **isFull** fields of the appropriate type to the table class.
