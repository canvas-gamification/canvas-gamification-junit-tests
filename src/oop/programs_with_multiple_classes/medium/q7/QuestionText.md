## Question Information:

- Question Type: Java

## Question Text:

You want to write a program that models kitchen utensils and kitchen tools. Make a Java program
consisting of a `Knife` and a `Cupboard`. See the requirements below for each class. Note that parts of each class are
already provided, you only need to implement the other portions.


## Knife

Your `Knife` class currently has the attributes `int size` and `String materialType`. Create a
constructor which is accessible from another class and initializes these fields in that order.


The `Knife` class currently has the following items:

- Attributes:
    - An `int` called **size**
    - A `String` called **materialType**

You must add the following items to complete the class:

- Constructors:
    - A constructor which is visible from another class and accepts an `int` and a `String` in that order as parameters
      and initializes the **size** and **materialType** fields with the input values.


## Cupboard

Your `Cupboard` class currently has a constructor, but is missing the fields the constructor sets. Based on the
constructor, add the **capacity** and **isFull** fields of the appropriate type to the table class.

The `Cupboard` class currently has the following items:

- Constructors:
    - A constructor which is visible from another
      and initialize the **capacity** and **isFull** fields.
You must add the following items to complete the class:
- Attributes:
    - Write the **capacity** and **isFull** with appropriate types.
