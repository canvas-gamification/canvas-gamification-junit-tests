## Java

You want to write a program that models technology and work surfaces. Make a Java program consisting of a `Monitor` 
and a `Desk`. See the requirements below for each class. Note that parts of each class are
already provided, you only need to implement the other portions.


## Monitor
Your `Monitor` class currently has the attribute `int countSize` and a constructor. Create a
method `fallen()` that decreases the value of **countSize** by 1 and is accessible from another class.
field.

## Desk

Your `Desk` class currently has the attributes `String materialType`. Create a
constructor which is accessible from another class and initializes this field.
