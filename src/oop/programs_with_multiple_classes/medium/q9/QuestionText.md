## Java

You want to write a program that models objects within a house and different rooms. Make a Java program
consisting of a `Monitor` and a `Desk`. See the requirements below for each class. Note that parts of each class are
already provided, you only need to implement the other portions.

## Monitor

Your `Monitor` class currently has the attributes `int countSize`, `String typeScreen`,
and `boolean isRenewed`. Create a constructor which is accessible from another class 
and initializes these fields in that order. Also, write a method called **recycled** that
sets the value of **isRenewed** to true, and is accessible from other classes.

## Desk

Your `Desk` class currently has a constructor, but is missing the fields the constructor sets. Based on the
constructor, add the **materialType** and **yearsOld** fields of the appropriate type to the table class.
