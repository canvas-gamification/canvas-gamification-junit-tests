**Parsons with Distractors**

You want to write a program that models technology and work surfaces. Make a Java program with the following requirements:


## Monitor

Your `Monitor` class should have the following items:

- Attributes:
    - An `int` called **countSize**
    - A `String` called **typeScreen**
    - A `boolean` called **isRenewed**

- Constructors:
    - A `public Monitor(int, String, boolean)` constructor to set the
      **countSize**, **typeScreen**, and **isRenewed** fields
- Methods:
    - A `public recycled()` method that sets the value of **isRenewed** to true.


## Desk

Your ``Desk`` class should have the following items:

- Attributes:
    - An `String` called **materialType**
    - A `int` called **yearsOld**

- Constructors:
    - A `public Desk(String, int)` constructor to set the
      **materialType** and **yearsOld** fields


**Distractors**
- d1.recycled();
- Monitor m2 = new Monitor( "27" );
- Monitor m1 = new Monitor( "21" );
- Desk d1 = new Desk( Wood );
- Monitor m2 = new Monitor( "27" , IPS );
- Monitor m1 = new Monitor( "21" , VA );
- Desk d1 = new Desk( Wood , 12 );
- d1 = new Desk( Wood );
- isRenewed = false;
- Monitor m2 = new Monitor( false );
