**Parsons with Distractors**

You want to write a program that models technology and work surfaces. Make a Java program with the following requirements:


## Monitor

Your `Monitor` class should have the following items:

- Attributes:
    - An `int` called **countSize**
    - A `String` called **typeScreen**
    - A `boolean` called **isRenewed**

- Constructors:
    - A `constructor` that takes an `int`, `String`, and `boolean` to set the
      **countSize**, **typeScreen**, and **isRenewed** fields
- Methods:
    - A `method` called **recycled** that sets the value of **isRenewed** to true.
    - A **toString** `method` is provided


## Desk

Your ``Desk`` class should have the following items:

- Attributes:
    - An `String` called **materialType**
    - A `int` called **yearsOld**

- Constructors:
    - A `constructor` that takes a `String` and an `int` to set the
      **materialType** and **yearsOld** fields
- Methods:
    - A `toString` method is provided

**Distractors**
- public String typeScreen;
- public boolean isRenewed;
- countSize = s;
- typeScreen = b;
- isRenewed = m;
- public recycled()
- public String materialType;
- public int yearsOld;
- materialType = i;
- yearsOld = m;
