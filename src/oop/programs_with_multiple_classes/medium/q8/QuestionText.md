**Parsons with Distractors**

You want to write a program that models objects within a house and different rooms. Make a Java program with the following requirements:


## Light

Your `Light` class should have the following items:

- Attributes:
    - An `boolean` called **isOn**
    - A `String` called **type**

- Constructors:
    - A `constructor` that takes a `boolean` and a `String` to set the
      **isOn** and **type** fields
- Methods:
    - A `toString` method is provided

## Kitchen

Your ``Kitchen`` class should have the following items:

- Attributes:
    - An `int` called **size**
    - A `int` called **personCapacity**

- Constructors:
    - A `constructor` that takes two `int` to set the
    **size** and **personCapacity** fields in that order
- Methods:
    - A `toString` method is provided


**Distractors**
- public boolean isOn;
- public String type;
- isOn = s;
- type = b;
- public int size;
- public int personCapacity;
- size = p;
- personCapacity = s;
- private Kitchen(int s, int p)
- private String toString()
