**Parsons with Distractors**

You want to write a program that models objects within a house and different rooms. Make a Java program with the following requirements:


## Light

Your `Light` class should have the following items:

- Attributes:
    - An `boolean` called **isOn**
    - A `String` called **type**

- Constructors:
    - A `public Light(boolean, String)` constructor to set the
      **isOn** and **type** fields

## Kitchen

Your ``Kitchen`` class should have the following items:

- Attributes:
    - An `int` called **size**
    - A `int` called **personCapacity**

- Constructors:
    - A `public Kitchen(int, int)` constructor to set the
    **size** and **personCapacity** fields


**Distractors**
- Light l1 = new Light( "LCD", true );
- Light l2 = new Light( false, "LED", 12 );
- Kitchen k = new Kitchen( 100 , 4.0 );
- Kitchen k = new Kitchen( 100 , 4, true );
- Kitchen k = new Kitchen( 10.0 );
