## Java

You want to write a program that models objects within a house and different rooms. Make a Java program
consisting of a `Light` and a `Kitchen`. See the requirements below for each class. Note that parts of each class are
already provided, you only need to implement the other portions.


## Light

Your `Knife` class currently has the attributes `boolean isOn` and `String type`. Create a
constructor which is accessible from another class and initializes these fields in that order.

## Kitchen

Your `Kitchen` class currently has a constructor, but is missing the fields the constructor sets. Based on the
constructor, add the **size** and **personCapacity** fields of the appropriate type to the table class.
