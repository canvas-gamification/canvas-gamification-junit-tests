# oop-programs_with_multiple_classes-medium-q1

You want to make a program that models a room with a chair and a table. To do this, you will create a Java program that
consists of a `Chair` and a `Table`. See the requirements below for each class. Note that parts of each class are
already provided, you only need to implement the other portions.

## Chair

Your `Chair` class currently has the attributes `String comfort`, `int weightCapacity`, and `int longevity`. Create a
constructor which is accessible from another class and initializes these fields. It should accept a String, an int, and 
another int in that order, with the first int corresponding to the weightCapacity field and the second the longevity
field.

## Table

Your `Table` class currently has a constructor, but is missing the fields the constructor sets. Based on the 
constructor, add the **woodType** and **numSeats** fields of the appropriate type to the table class.
