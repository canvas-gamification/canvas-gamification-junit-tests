## Java

You want to write a program that models vehicular components within different types of vehicles. Make a Java program consisting of 
a `Wheel` and a `Chassis`. See the requirements below for each class. Note that parts of each class are
already provided, you only need to implement the other portions.


## Wheel

Your `Wheel` class currently has the attributes `double durability` and `String manufacturer`. Create a
constructor which is accessible from another class and initializes these fields in that order.


## Chassis

Your `Chassis` class currently has a constructor, but is missing the fields the constructor sets. Based on the
constructor, add the `String materialType` field of the appropriate type to the table class.
