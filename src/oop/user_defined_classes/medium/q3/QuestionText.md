## Java

Teaching young children to make animal sounds is fun and helps them 
improve their language skills. Make a Java class called `Horse`
that has an attribute called **weight**, a constructor that 
initializes the **weight**, and one method called **makeSound **
that returns `Neigh!!`.



### Horse Class

The `Horse` class you are given has the following items:

- Attributes:
    - A `double` called **weight** that is not accessible from other classes
- Constructors:
    - An empty constructor with its parameters.

You must add the following items to the class:

- Constructors:
    - Initializes **weight**
      with the input values in the constructor.
    - If the weight value is negative it should be initialized as 0.
- Method:
    - Write a **makeSound** method that returns the `String` "Neigh!!"
  is `"Neigh!!"`
