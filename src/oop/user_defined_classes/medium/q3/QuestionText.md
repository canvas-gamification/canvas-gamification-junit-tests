## Java

Teaching young children to make animal sounds is fun and helps them 
improve their language skills. Make a Java class called Horse
that has an attribute called weight, a constructor that 
initializes the weight, and one method called makeSound 
that returns "Neigh!!".



### Horse Class

The `Horse` class you are given has the following items:

- A `Horse` class name
- An empty `Horse` constructor 
- A `double` called **weight**

You must add the following items to the class:

- Constructors:
    - Initializes **weight**
      with the input values in the constructor.
    - If the weight value is negative it should be initialized as 0.
- Method:
    - Write a **makeSound** method that return a `String` that
  is `"Neigh!!"`
