## Java

Teaching young children to make animal sounds is fun and helps them 
improve their language skills. Make a Java class called `Horse`
to model a horse.

### Horse Class

The `Horse` class you are given has the following items:

- Attributes:
    - A `double` called **weight** that is not accessible from other classes

You must add the following items to the class:

- Constructors:
    - A constructor that accepts a `double` as a parameter and uses it to initialize the **weight** attribute. If the input double parameter is negative, initialize the **weight** attribute to zero. This constructor must be visible from other classes.
    
- Method:
    - Write a **makeSound** method that returns the `String` "Neigh!!"
    - It should be accessible from other classes.
