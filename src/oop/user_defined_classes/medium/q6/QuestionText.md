## Java

Teachers need to have an efficient way to keep track of each student and how they do in their coursework. Make a Java class called `Homework` with the requirements below to track the students and their coursework.

## Homework

The `Homework` class you are given has the following items:

- Constructors:
    - A constructor that initializes the **marks** and **studentNumber** attributes
    - It should be accessible from other classes.

You need to add the following items:

- Attributes:
    - A `double` attribute called **marks**
    - An `int` attribute called **studentNumber**
    - All of these attributes must not be accessible from other classes.
