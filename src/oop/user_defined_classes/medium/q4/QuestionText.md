## Java

We always get thirsty in the summer, and it is important to stay hydrated. Make a Java
class called `Water` that has two attributes called **volume** and **quality** with a constructor
that initializes them.

## Water

The `Water` class you are given has the following items:

- Attributes:
    - A `double` called **volume** that is not accessible from another class.
    - A `String` called **quality** that is not accessible from another class.

You need to add the following items:

- Constructor:
    - Create a constructor that initializes these attributes in that order. Also, if the input
      for volume is negative it should be initialized 0.
