## Java

We always get thirsty in the summer and it is important to stay hydrated. Make a Java 
class called Water that has two attributes called volume and quality with a constructor 
that initializes them.



## Water

The `Water` class you are given has the following items:

- Attributes:
  - A `double` called **volume**
  - A `String` called **quality**
- Constructor:
  - Create a constructor that initializes these fields in that order. Also, if the input
  for volume is negative it should be initialized 0.
