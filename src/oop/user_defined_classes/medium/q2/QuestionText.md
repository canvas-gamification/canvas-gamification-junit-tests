## Java

Little boys love to play with cars and trucks and watch things move. 
Make a Java class called `Car` that has attributes called **colour**, 
**horsePower**, and **yearMade**. This class also has a constructor for 
initializing the attributes and another method called **improve**
that doubles the **horsepower** of the vehicle.


### Car Class

The `Car` class you are given has the following items:

- Constructors:
    - Initializes **colour**, **horsePower**, and **yearMade**
      with the input values in the constructor and is visible in other classes.

You need to add the following items:

- Attributes:
    - A `String` called **colour** that is not accessible from other classes
    - An `int` called **horsePower** that is not accessible from other classes
    - An `int` called **yearMade** that is not accessible from other classes
- Methods:
    - Create a method called **improve** that doubles the **horsePower**
    - The method should not return anything.
