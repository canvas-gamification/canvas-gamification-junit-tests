## Java

Little boys love to play with cars and trucks and watch things move. 
Using the requirements below, create a `Car` class to model a toy car.

### Car Class

The `Car` already has the following items:

- Constructors:
    - Initializes **colour**, **horsePower**, and **yearMade**
      with the input values in the constructor and is visible in other classes.

You need to add the following items:

- Attributes:
    - A `String` called **colour** that is not accessible from other classes
    - An `int` called **horsePower** that is not accessible from other classes
    - An `int` called **yearMade** that is not accessible from other classes
- Methods:
    - A method called **improve**:
        - It must double the value of the **horsePower** attribute
        - It must not return anything
        - It must be accessible from any other class
