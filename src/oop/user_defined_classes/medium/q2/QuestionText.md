## Java

Little boys love to play with cars and trucks and watch things move. 
Make a Java class called Car that has attributes called colour, 
horsePower, and yearMade. This class also has a constructor for 
initializing the attributes and another method called printSpecs() 
that displays the colour and horsepower of the vehicle.
