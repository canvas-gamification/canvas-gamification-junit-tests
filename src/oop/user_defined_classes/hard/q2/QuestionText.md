### DishWasher Class:

Your `DishWasher` class should have the following items:

- Attributes:
    - An `int` called **forks**
    - An `int` called **knives**

- Constructors:
    - A constructor which accepts two ints and sets the **forks** and **knives** fields. The first int should
      set **forks** field and the second the **knives** field.

- Methods:
    - A method called `loadDishWasher` which another class can give the number of dirty forks to be subtracted from the 
      total number of **forks**. Then the method should print "**forks** forks are still clean" to the console.
