## Question Text

Traveling can be a lot of fun, but you have to make sure you pack the right stuff to bring with you. Write a Java class
called `Luggage` to track your stuff. See the description below for the requirements.

### Luggage Class:

Your `Luggage` class should have the following items:

- Attributes:
    - An `int` called **numShirts**
    - An `int` called **numPants**

- Constructors:
    - A constructor which accepts two ints and sets the **numShirts** and **numPants** fields. The first int should
      set **numShirts** field and the second the **numPants** field.

- Methods:
    - A method called `sumItems` which another class can use to determine the total number of items in the luggage (the sum of the items)
