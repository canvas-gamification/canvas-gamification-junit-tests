## Question Text

The way stores calculate screen sizes are kind of confusing. Write a Java class called `Phone` to compute the 
diagonal of the screen. See the description below for the requirements.

### Phone Class:

Your `Phone` class should have the following items:

- Attributes:
    - An `double` called **width**
    - An `double` called **height**

- Constructors:
    - A constructor which accepts two doubles and sets the **width** and **height** fields. The first double should
      set **width** field and the second the **height** field.

- Methods:
    - A method called `calcScreenSize` which another class can use to compute the diagonal of the screen using the 
      Pythagorean Theorem.
