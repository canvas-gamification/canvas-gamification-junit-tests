## Question Text

Life is busy and there's always lots of work to do! Write a Java class called `UniversityStudent` to keep track of and
complete work.


See the description below for the requirements.

### UniversityStudent Class:

Your `UniversityStudent` class should have the following items:

- Attributes:
    - An `int` called **fatigueLevel**
    - An `int` called **workload**

- Constructors:
    - A constructor which accepts two ints and sets the **fatigueLevel** and **workload** fields. The first int should
      set **fatigueLevel** field and the second the **workload** field.

- Methods:
    - A method called `workAllDay` which another class can use to complete the workload, however for every piece of work
      completed increases the fatigue level. The method should print "Fatigue level is **fatigueLevel**" once all work
      is completed.
