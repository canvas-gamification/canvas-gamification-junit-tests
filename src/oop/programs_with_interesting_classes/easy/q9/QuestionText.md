## Question Text

You are environmentally conscious and you want to know how much greenhouse gasses are generated by each activity.
Make a class called `Activity` with the attributes **type** and **dailyEmissionRate**

### Activity Class

The `Activity` class has the following requirements:

- Attributes
    - Note that none of the attributes in this class should be visible from another class
    - A `String` attribute called **type**
    - A `double` attribute called **dailyEmissionRate**

- Constructors:
    - A constructor visible from another class that accepts a `String` and a `double` as parameters, and uses
      the values to initialize the **type* and **dailyEmissionRate** attributes
    - Note that this constructor should be visible from all other classes.

- Methods:
    - An accessor method for the **type** attribute called `getType`.
    - An accessor method for the **dailyEmissionRate** attribute called `getDailyEmissionRate`..

### TestWaterConsumption class

- Main method:
    - In the main method create 3 `Activity` classes and then find the activity with the worst (highest) greenhouse gas
      emission and then print it.
