## Question Text

You are about to start writing a program that involves luminous objects. Make a Java class called `Lamp` that has two 
attributes called **brightness** and **isOn**. The class also has two constructors, on with 2 parameters to initialize
two field and one with 1 parameter and set the second field to the default value.

### Circle Class:

Your `Lamp` class must have the following items

- Attributes:
    - a `double` called **brightness**
    - a `boolean` called **isOn**

- Constructor:
    - a `Lamp` constructor that is visible to other classes and accepts a `double` and uses it to initialize the
      **brightness** field and initializes the **isOn** field to true.
    - a `Lamp` constructor that is visible to other classes and accepts a `double` and a `boolean` and uses it to 
      initialize the **brightness** and **isOn** fields.

- Methods:
    - a `setBrightness` method which accepts a `double` and uses it to set the value of the **brightness** field
    - a `getBrightness` method which returns the value stored in the **brightness** field
    - a `setIsOn` method which accepts a `boolean` and uses it to set the value of the **isOn** field
    - a `getIsOn` method which returns the value stored in the **isOn** field
