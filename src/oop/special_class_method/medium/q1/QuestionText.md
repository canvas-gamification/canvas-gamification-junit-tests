## Question Text

You are about to start writing a program that has objects of different sizes. Make a Java class called `Circle`
that has one attribute called `size` with a constructor that initializes it, an accessor and mutator for the attribute,
and a `toString` method. See the `Circle` class details for more information. Note that all the methods described below
should be accessible outside the `Circle` class.

### Circle Class:

Your `Circle` class must have the following items

- Attributes:
    - a `double` called **size**

- Constructor:
    - a `Circle` constructor that is visible to other classes and accepts a `double` and uses it to initialize the **
      size** field

- Methods:
    - a `setSize` method which accepts a `double` and uses it to set the value of the **size** field
    - a `getSize` method which returns the value stored in the **size** field
    - a `toString` method which returns the string `"My size is " + size` where `size` is the value of the **size**
      field
