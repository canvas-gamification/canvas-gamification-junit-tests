## Question Text

It's April fool's day and you want to change how the calculator works so you can trick your Math teacher. Make a Java 
class called `Calculator` that has two attributes called **sum** and **isCorrect** whose values are initialized in the 
constructor. In particular, **sum** is set to the input parameter times 7. The class also has an accessor and mutator 
method for each attribute.


### Calculator:

Your `Calculator` class must have the following items

- Attributes:
    - a `double` called **sum**
    - a `boolean` called **isCorrect**

- Constructor:
    - a `Calculator` constructor that is visible to other classes and accepts a `double` and a `boolean` and uses it to initialize the
      **sum** and **isCorrect** fields with **sum** being 7 times of the input value.
 

- Methods:
    - a `setSum` method which accepts a `double` and uses it to set the value of the **sum** field
    - a `getSum` method which returns the value stored in the **sum** field
    - a `setIsCorrect` method which accepts a `boolean` and uses it to set the value of the **isCorrect** field
    - a `getIsCorrect` method which returns the value stored in the **isCorrect** field
