## Question Text

You are developing a wholesale application consisting of items that can be purchased in large quantities. Make a Java 
class called **Detergent** that has two attributes called **colour** and **volume**

### Detergent Class:

Your `Detergent` class already has the following items:

- Attributes:
    - A `String` called **colour**
    - A `String` called **manufacturer**
    - These are not visible from other classes

- Constructor:
    - a `Detergent` constructor that is visible to other classes and accepts two `String` and uses it to
      initialize the **colour** and **manufacturer** attributes.

You need to add the following items:

- Methods:
    - a `setManufacturer` method which accepts a `String` and uses it to set the value of the **manufacturer** attribute
    - a `getManufacturer` method which returns the value stored in the **manufacturer** attribute
    - These methods must be visible from other classes.
