## Question Text

You want to write a program where you can control the volume of noisy objects. Make a Java class called `Speaker` that 
has an attribute called **volume** which is initialized in the constructor. The class also includes an accessor and a 
mutator for each attribute.


### Speaker

Your `Speaker` class must have the following items

- Attributes:
    - a `double` called **volume**

- Constructor:
    - a `Speaker` constructor that is visible to other classes and accepts a `double` and uses it to initialize the
      **volume** field

- Methods:
    - a `setVolume` method which accepts a `double` and uses it to set the value of the **volume** field
    - a `getVolume` method which returns the value stored in the **volume** field
