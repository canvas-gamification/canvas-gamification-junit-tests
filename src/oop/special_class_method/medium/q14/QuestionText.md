## Question Text

As an employee of a material processing facility, you are tasked with modelling the facility's functionalities. Make a
Java class called **Water** that has an attribute called **quality** and another attribute called **volume**.

### Water Class:

Your `Water` class already has the following items:

- Attributes:
    - A `String` called **quality**
    - A `double` called **volume**
    - These are not visible from other classes

- Constructor:
    - a `Water` constructor that is visible to other classes
      initialize the **quality** and **volume** attributes to `Good` and 1000.0.

You need to add the following items:

- Methods:
    - a `setVolume` method which accepts a `double` and uses it to set the value of the **volume** attribute
    - a `getVolume` method which returns the value stored in the **volume** attribute
    - These methods must be visible from other classes.
