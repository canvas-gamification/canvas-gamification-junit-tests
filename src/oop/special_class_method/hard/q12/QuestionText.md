## Question Text

You are developing a program that teaches people about the physical traits of a variety of human-made objects. Write a 
Java class called **Laptop** that has two attributes, an `int` called **yearMade** and a `String` called **texture** 
that are initialized by the constructor

### Laptop Class:

Your `Laptop` class must have the following items:

- Attributes:
    - An `int` called **yearMade**
    - A `String` called **colour**
    - These are not visible from other classes

- Constructor:
    - a `Laptop` constructor that is visible to other classes and accepts an `int` and a `String` and uses it to initialize
      the **yearMade** and **colour** attributes.

- Methods:
    - a `setYearMade` method which accepts an `int` and uses it to set the value of the **yearMade** attribute
    - a `getYearMade` method which returns the value stored in the **yearMade** attribute
    - a `setColour` method which accepts a `String` and uses it to set the value of the **colour** attribute
    - a `getColour` method which returns the value stored in the **colour** attribute
    - These methods must be visible from other classes.
