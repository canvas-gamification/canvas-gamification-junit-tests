## Question Text

Many people are fascinated by our planet's solar system. Make a Java class called Earth with two attributes; a double
landMass and an integer named population. Earth should have a constructor visible from other classes which accepts a
double and integer (in that order) and initializes the corresponding Fields using these values. Also, these fields must
not be accessible from other classes. As such, compose the necessary methods so that these attributes can be accessed
and modified from outside the class.

## Distractors

- setLandMass( lm );
- setPopulation( p );
- return Population;
- return population = a;
- public int population;
- public double landMass;
- private class Earth
- public Earth()
- int population;
- double landMass;
- public String toString()
- public static void setLandMass(double a)
- private Earth( double landMass, int population)
