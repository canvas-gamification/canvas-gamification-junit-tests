## Question Text

You want to write a program that models balls in a sports room. To do this, create a Java program with two
classes: `Basketball` and `Sportsroom`. See the requirements below for each class.

## Basketball Class

Your `Basketball` class should have the following items:

- Attributes:
    - A `double` called **size**
- Constructors:
    - A constructor which accepts a double to initialize the **size** field and is accessible from other classes

## Sportsroom Class

Your `Sportsroom` class should have a method called `makeBalls` which takes an array of doubles representing sizes of
the balls and creates a `Basketball` object with each of those sizes. These objects are then stored in an array and
returned as the method's output.
