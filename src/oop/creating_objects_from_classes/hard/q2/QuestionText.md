Note: for this question give the student the entire WaterToy file, and nothing from the SummerFun file (not even the class header).
You can just leave a comment saying something like // code your SummerFun class heere

## Question Text

Suppose you have defined a `WaterToy` class, and now you want to define a `SummerFun` class. In the `SummerFun` class, you need to define
a method called `inflateToy` that takes a String as input for a name and returns a **WaterToy** object. Use the constructor in
the provided `WaterToy` class to do this.
