Note: for this question give the student the entire Dog file, and nothing from the Pet file (not even the class header).
You can just leave a comment saying something like // code your Pet class here

## Question Text

Suppose you have defined a `Dog` class, and now you want to define a `Pet` class. In the `Pet` class, you need to define
a method called `makePet` that takes a String as input for a name and returns a **Dog** object. Use the constructor in
the provided `Dog` class to do this.
