Make a Java program that prints out the area of a sector of a circle. A sector of a circle is like a pizza slice.
Your program will be given the radius of the circle and the degrees of the sector which you will need to convert to radians.
Recall that the formula for the area of a sector of a circle is:
Area = (r^2)𝜃/2 where 𝜃 is in radians and r is the circle's radius.

        double area = ( radius*radius*radiansOfSector )/2;
