/*
Write a Java Program that asks users for the year they were born, then prints the century the individual was born.
The program should have a method called centuryCalc, which determines the century and works for any century from the
1500â€™s (16th Century) to the 2000's (21st Century). If the input is in any other century, return "Unknown Century".
Sample output:
Please enter the year you were born in:
2002
You're from the 21st Century

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Please enter the year you were born in: ");
        int userYear = input.nextInt();
        System.out.println("You're from the " + centuryCalc(userYear));
