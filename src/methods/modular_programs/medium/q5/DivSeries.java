/**
 * Write a Java program called DivSeries that includes a method called divisionCalc. This method should take an integer
 * n and calculate the sum of integer values of the series 20/1 + 20/2 + 20/3 +
 *  * 20/4 + 20/5 + 20/6 + â€¦ 20/n. Your main method should take a number n called the method and print the answer in the
 *  following format.
 *
 *  Sample Output:
 *  Enter a number for the upper bound of the series:
 *  5
 *  The sum of the series is 45
