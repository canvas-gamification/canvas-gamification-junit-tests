## Get Started
### Requirements
- JDK 15
- Jetbrains IntelliJ (Highly Recommended, but other IDE's are fine)

### Instructions
Cloning the repo should be all that is needed, however if you are using JetBrains IntelliJ then you may need to create an empty project, initialize it as a git repository, and then manually set its remote origin to this repo.
1. Create an empty JetBrains IntelliJ Java Project (without Maven, Groovy, or other libraries).
2. Open a terminal window within this project's root directory.
3. Run `git init` to initialize this project as a git repository.
4. Run `git remote add origin <REPO_LINK>` where `REPO_LINK` is the link to this git repository.
5. Run `git branch -M main` to complete this setup.
- With IntelliJ, your UI should update to display the git-based features at the bottom right and top right of the window. Once this happens then you're good to go!
